SMB2 Character Randomizer V0.24 Beta

By MaCobra52


This is a simple randomizer for Super Mario Bros 2 that modifies the game so that in each level you are locked into selecting one character chosen at random. The character is automatically highlighted and you cannot use left/right to change them.

And yep...that's pretty much it for now. There may be more features added along the line, but for now we're keeping it simple and fun. :)


First Time Instructions:

Ensure that you have Java 8 or later installed on your machine prior to running. If needed you can download from the link below:
https://www.java.com/en/

1. Double-click the exe to start the randomizer.
2. Select the base SMB2U ROM (PRG0 or PRG1/Rev A) that you would like to use along with the output directory of the randomized ROM.
3. Enter a number for the seed, or use the one provided.
4. If you wish to adjust the randomizer weights (odds), lives, continues, starting health, or character colors, adjust the appropriate options on each tab.
5. click 'Generate!'

At this point you can close the randomizer and play! The randomizer will remember the previous files, directories, and settings chosen, so in the future all you need to do is adjust the seed (if desired) and click 'Generate!'


Notes:

-The base ROM selected should be a clean PRG0 or PRG1/Rev A SMB2U ROM. The randomizer will let you use other ROMS, but there are no guarantees that it will work succesfully.

-If you are planning a race, be sure that all participants enter the same seed to generate the same randomization. Additionally a hash will be displayed on the title screen (in place of the copyright) to confirm that everything matches. The Hash should match regardless of color selection, but will NOT match if different weights/lives/continues/health settings are picked.


Special Thanks To:
